# Bind Action Creators
redux studies

***Turns an object whose values are action creators, into an object with the same keys, but with every action creator wrapped into a dispatch call so they may be invoked directly.***

* The only use case for bindActionCreators is when you want to pass some action creators down to a component that isnâ€™t aware of Redux
